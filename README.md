Archive of common vscode setups and example
"hello world" code for a variety of different languages.

It's a common occurrance that whilst VScode can be
used to write code, it's often not setup correctly and
lacks breakpoint functionality, which can often be irritating
to setup.  This repo. attempts to rectify this common problem
and provide pre-built .vscode files and devcontainer files.

<li>Working breakpoints!</li>
<li>One click "F5" build and running</li>
</ul>
