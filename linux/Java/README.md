<b>Hello-Java-World</b>

This application allows the compilation and execution
of a simple Java "Hello World" application.
To run;

<ul>
<li><b>Ensure project is open within the development container</b></li>
<li><b>Hit F5</b></li>
</ul>

Java is an object oriented language, designed for "portability" in mind (although, it doesn't quite achieve this in practise)

This application demonstrates the following;

<ul>
<li>VS code debugging and breakpoint functionality</li>
<li>Docker development container configuration</li>
</ul>

Requirements;

The VSCode development container plugin is installed;

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

Docker must also be installed;

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

This application, however is configured with linux based containers, and will not work correctly on Windows without modification.
