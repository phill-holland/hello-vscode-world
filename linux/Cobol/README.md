<b>Hello-COBOL-World</b>

This application allows the compilation and execution
of a simple COBOL "Hello World" application.
To run;

<ul>
<li><b>Ensure project is open within the development container</b></li>
<li><b>Hit F5</b></li>
</ul>

COBOL is a legacy computer language, designed initally for mainframe computers and financial transactional systems.  It is also responsible for my RSI, due to it's requirement for excessive
amounts of useless characters within it's lexicon.

This application demonstrates the following;

<ul>
<li>VS code debugging and breakpoint functionality</li>
<li>Docker development container configuration</li>
</ul>

Requirements;

The VSCode development container plugin is installed;

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

Docker must also be installed;

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

This application, however is configured with linux based containers, and will not work correctly on Windows without modification.
